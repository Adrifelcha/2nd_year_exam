  abstract = {Individual differences in the ability to control visual attention, often termed `attentional control', has been of particular interest to cognitive researchers. Researchers' interest in attentional control has led to the development of specific tasks intended to measure this attentional ability. One such task is the anti-saccade task. While attentional performance on the anti-saccade task is typically indexed through the recording of eye movements, increasingly researchers are reporting the use of probe-based methods of indexing attentional performance on the task. Critically, no research has yet determined the convergence of indices of performance yielded by each of these assessment methods, nor compared the reliability of these indices. The purpose of the present study is to examine whether the index of attentional control yielded by a probe-based adaptation of the task converges with the index of attentional control provided by the traditional eye movement task, and whether these alternative approaches have comparable levels of psychometric reliability. The present study will require individuals to complete a probe-based task and an eye movement task, and an index of anti-saccade cost will be computed from each. Correlational analyses will determine the degree to which the anti-saccade cost indices provided by each task converge in their assessment of individual differences in attention control. Further analyses will compare the internal consistency of these two anti-saccade cost indices, and their reliability over time. This manuscript has passed peer review and has been issued an in-principle acceptance (IPA) by the Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, indicating that the article will be published pending successful completion of the study according to the exact methods and analytic procedures outlined, as well as a defensible and evidence-bound interpretation of the results.},

  abstract = {Analysis of Ordinal Categorical Data Alan Agresti Statistical Science Now has its first coordinated manual of methods for analyzing ordered categorical data. This book discusses specialized models that, unlike standard methods underlying nominal categorical data, efficiently use the information on ordering. It begins with an introduction to basic descriptive and inferential methods for categorical data, and then gives thorough coverage of the most current developments, such as loglinear and logit models for ordinal data. Special emphasis is placed on interpretation and application of methods and contains an integrated comparison of the available strategies for analyzing ordinal data. This is a case study work with illuminating examples taken from across the wide spectrum of ordinal categorical applications. 1984 (0 471-89055-3) 287 pp. Regression Diagnostics Identifying Influential Data and Sources of Collinearity David A. Belsley, Edwin Kuh and Roy E. Welsch This book provides the practicing statistician and econometrician with new tools for assessing the quality and reliability of regression estimates. Diagnostic techniques are developed that aid in the systematic location of data points that are either unusual or inordinately influential; measure the presence and intensity of collinear relations among the regression data and help to identify the variables involved in each; and pinpoint the estimated coefficients that are potentially most adversely affected. The primary emphasis of these contributions is on diagnostics, but suggestions for remedial action are given and illustrated. 1980 (0 471-05856-4) 292 pp. Applied Regression Analysis Second Edition Norman Draper and Harry Smith Featuring a significant expansion of material reflecting recent advances, here is a complete and up-to-date introduction to the fundamentals of regression analysis, focusing on understanding the latest concepts and applications of these methods. The authors thoroughly explore the fitting and checking of both linear and nonlinear regression models, using small or large data sets and pocket or high-speed computing equipment. Features added to this Second Edition include the practical implications of linear regression; the Durbin-Watson test for serial correlation; families of transformations; inverse, ridge, latent root and robust regression; and nonlinear growth models.

  abstract = {Several current models hold that frontoparietal areas exert cognitive control by biasing task-relevant processing in other brain areas. Previous event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have compared prosaccades and antisaccades, which require subjects to look toward or away from a flashed peripheral stimulus, respectively. These studies found greater activation for antisaccades in frontal and parietal regions at the ends of long ({$\geq$}6 s) preparatory periods preceding peripheral stimulus presentation. Event-related fMRI studies using short preparatory periods ({$\leq$}4 s) have not found such activation differences except in the frontal eye field. Here, we identified activation differences associated with short (1-s) preparatory periods by interleaving half trials among regular whole trials in a rapid fMRI design. On whole trials, a colored fixation dot instructed human subjects to make either a prosaccade toward or an antisaccade away from a peripheral visual stimulus. Half trials included only the instruction and not peripheral stimulus presentation or saccade generation. Nonetheless, half trials evoked stronger activation on antisaccades than on prosaccades in the frontal eye field (FEF), supplementary eye field (SEF), left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and precuneus. Greater antisaccade response-related activation was found in FEF, SEF, IPS, and precuneus but not in DLPFC or ACC. These results demonstrate greater preparatory activation for antisaccades versus prosaccades in frontoparietal areas and suggest that prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex are more involved in presetting the saccade network for the antisaccade task than generating the actual antisaccade response.},

WMC predicted 51.8\% of variance in insight problem solving and virtually explained its almost isomorphic link to reasoning ability (84.6\% of shared variance). The strong link between WMC and insight pertained generally to most WM tasks and insight problems, was identical for problems solved with and without reported insight, was linear throughout the ability levels, and was not mediated by age, motivation, anxiety, psychoticism, and openness to experience. In contrast to popular views on the sudden and holistic nature of insight, the solving of insight problems results primarily from typical operations carried out by the basic WM mechanisms that are responsible for the maintenance, retrieval, transformation, and control of information in the broad range of intellectual tasks (including fluid reasoning). Little above and beyond WM is unique about insight. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Other studies proposed that there are several subclasses of illusions, such as illusions of linear extent or distortions. We previously observed strong within-illusion correlations but only weak between-illusion correlations, arguing in favor of an even higher multifactorial space with\textemdash more or less\textemdash each illusion making up its own factor. These mixed results are surprising. Here, we examined to what extent individual differences in the perception of visual illusions are stable across eyes, time, and measurement methods. First, we did not find any significant differences in the magnitudes of the seven illusions tested with monocular or binocular viewing conditions. In addition, illusion magnitudes were not significantly predicted by visual acuity. Second, we observed stable individual differences over time. Last, we compared two illusion measurements, namely an adjustment procedure and a method of constant stimuli, which both led to similar individual differences. Hence, it is unlikely that the individual differences in the perception of visual illusions arise from instability across eyes, time, and measurement methods.},

We argue that this relationship does indeed exist but that the dependent variable used to measure task switching is problematic. To support our claim, we reanalyzed data from two studies with a new scoring procedure that combines reaction time (RT) and accuracy into a single score. The reanalysis revealed a strong relationship between task switching and WMC that was not present when RT-based switch costs were used as the dependent variable. We discuss the theoretical implications of this finding along with the potential uses and limitations of the scoring procedure we used. More broadly, we emphasize the importance of using measures that incorporate speed and accuracy in other areas of research, particularly in comparisons of subjects differing in cognitive and developmental levels.},

In the article ``What Item Response Theory Can Tell Us About the Complex Span Tasks,'' by Christopher Draheim, Tyler L. Harrison, Susan E. Embretson, and Randall W. Engle (Psychological Assessment, 2018, Vol. 30, No. 1, pp. 116\textendash 129, http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/pas0000444), a programming error in the operation span task in Study 2 resulted in set size 8 being administered instead of set size 9. Set sizes 3\textendash 7 were administered as intended, but set size 8 was administered twice in each block instead of one instance of set size 8 and one instance of set size 9 per block. As such, all references to set size 9 should be interpreted as an additional administration of set size 8. This error has some minor implications for the results and conclusions of Study 2 whereby it can no longer be confidently asserted that an operation span task with set sizes 8 and 9 added would be any less suitable for higher ability subjects than the rotation and symmetry span tasks. However, the error has no bearing on the argument that the standard administration of the operation span (set sizes 3\textendash 7) is lacking and that the addition of larger set sizes to the operation span vastly improves its utility for testing higher ability individuals.] Working memory capacity is an important construct in psychology because of its relationship with many higher-order cognitive abilities and psychopathologies. Working memory capacity is often measured using a type of paradigm known as complex span. Some recent work has focused on shortening the administration time of the complex span tasks, resulting in different versions of these tasks being used (Foster et al., 2015; Oswald, McAbee, Redick, \& Hambrick, 2015). Variations in the complex span tasks, such as the number of set sizes, can lead to varying power to discriminate individuals at different ability levels. Thus, research findings may be inconsistent across populations due to differing appropriateness for the ability levels. The present study uses a combination of item response theory and correlational analyses to better understand the psychometric properties of the operation span, symmetry span, and rotation span. The findings show that the typical administration of these tasks, particularly the operation span, is not suitable for above average ability samples (Study 1; n = 573). When larger set sizes are added to the tasks (Study 2; n = 351), predictive validity and discriminability is improved for all complex span tasks, however the operation span is still inferior to the spatial tasks. The authors make several conclusions about which tasks and set sizes should be used depending on the intended population, and further suggest avoiding the standard-length operation span for average or higher ability populations.

Despite this popularity, there are numerous issues associated with using reaction time (RT), specifically in differential and developmental research. Here, we identify and focus on two main problems\textemdash unreliability and sensitivity to speed\textendash accuracy interactions. The use of difference scores is a primary factor that leads to many RT measures having demonstrably low reliability, and RT measures in general often do not properly account for speed\textendash accuracy interactions. Both factors jeopardize the validity and interpretability of results based on RT. Here, we evaluate conceptually and empirically how these issues affect individual differences research. Although the empirical evidence we provide are primarily within the domains of attention control and task switching, we highlight examples from various other areas of psychological inquiry. We also discuss many of the statistical and methodological alternatives available to researchers conducting correlational studies. Ultimately, we encourage researchers comparing individuals of differing cognitive and developmental levels to strongly consider using these alternatives in lieu of RT, specifically RT difference scores.

This wide interest is in part due to the putative relations between self-regulation and a range of real-world behaviors. Self-regulation is generally viewed as a trait, and individual differences are quantified using a diverse set of measures, including self-report surveys and behavioral tasks. Accurate characterization of individual differences requires measurement reliability, a property frequently characterized in self-report surveys, but rarely assessed in behavioral tasks. We remedy this gap by (i) providing a comprehensive literature review on an extensive set of self-regulation measures and (ii) empirically evaluating test\textendash retest reliability of this battery in a new sample. We find that dependent variables (DVs) from self-report surveys of self-regulation have high test\textendash retest reliability, while DVs derived from behavioral tasks do not. This holds both in the literature and in our sample, although the test\textendash retest reliability estimates in the literature are highly variable. We confirm that this is due to differences in between-subject variability. We also compare different types of task DVs (e.g., model parameters vs. raw response times) in their suitability as individual difference DVs, finding that certain model parameters are as stable as raw DVs. Our results provide greater psychometric footing for the study of self-regulation and provide guidance for future studies of individual differences in this domain.},

Recent results indicated that especially latencies of ERP components associated with higher-order processing (P2, N2, and P3) may share up to 80\% of variance with individual differences in intelligence. WMC has a similar predictive power and thus these two processes cannot explain individual differences in intelligence independently. The current study explores in how far individual differences in executive functions (EFs) may bridge the gap between WMC and PS as predictors of intelligence. We recruited 101 participants who completed three EF tasks \textendash{} one for each of the three executive functions shifting, updating, and inhibition. Additionally, we assessed participants' intelligence, WMC, and PS. Results showed that only variance of behavioral RTs consistent across manipulations in the EF tasks was related to WMC, PS, and intelligence. The variance specific to the manipulations in EF tasks was small and showed no consistent correlations with each other or with any of the three covariates. These results suggest that EF tasks capture mostly manipulation-unspecific cognitive processes. Hence, individual differences in the impairment due to additional executive processing demands cannot explain why WMC and PS are related predictors of individual differences in intelligence.},

  abstract = {Factor analytic models are widely used in social sciences. These models have also proven useful for sparse modeling of the covariance structure in multidimensional data. Normal prior distributions for factor loadings and inverse gamma prior distributions for residual variances are a popular choice because of their conditionally conjugate form. However, such prior distributions require elicitation of many hyperparameters and tend to rsult in poorly behaved Gibbs samplers. In addition, one must choose an informative specification, as high variance prior distributions face problems due to impropriety of the posterior distribution. This article proposes a default, heavy-tailed prior distribution specification, which is induced through parameter expansion while facilitating efficient posterior computation. We also develop an approach to allow uncertainty in the number of factors. The methods are illustrated through simulated examples and epidemiology and toxicology applications. Data sets and computer code used in this article are available online.}

  abstract = {Individual differences in cognitive paradigms are increasingly employed to relate cognition to brain structure, chemistry, and function. However, such efforts are often unfruitful, even with the most well established tasks. Here we offer an explanation for failures in the application of robust cognitive paradigms to the study of individual differences. Experimental effects become well established \textendash{} and thus those tasks become popular \textendash{} when between-subject variability is low. However, low between-subject variability causes low reliability for individual differences, destroying replicable correlations with other factors and potentially undermining published conclusions drawn from correlational relationships. Though these statistical issues have a long history in psychology, they are widely overlooked in cognitive psychology and neuroscience today. In three studies, we assessed test-retest reliability of seven classic tasks: Eriksen Flanker, Stroop, stop-signal, go/no-go, Posner cueing, Navon, and Spatial-Numerical Association of Response Code (SNARC). Reliabilities ranged from 0 to .82, being surprisingly low for most tasks given their common use. As we predicted, this emerged from low variance between individuals rather than high measurement variance. In other words, the very reason such tasks produce robust and easily replicable experimental effects \textendash{} low between-participant variability \textendash{} makes their use as correlational tools problematic. We demonstrate that taking such reliability estimates into account has the potential to qualitatively change theoretical conclusions. The implications of our findings are that well-established approaches in experimental psychology and neuropsychology may not directly translate to the study of individual differences in brain structure, chemistry, and function, and alternative metrics may be required.},

However, extant work in this area has been limited by failure to account for the unity and diversity of EFs, focus on only a single measure of bias and/or EF, and relatively small sample sizes. The current study sought to comprehensively model the relation between individual differences in EFs and the expression of racial bias in 3 commonly used laboratory measures. Participants (N = 485) completed a battery of EF tasks (Session 1) and 3 racial bias tasks (Session 2), along with numerous individual difference questionnaires. The main findings were as follows: (a) measures of implicit bias were only weakly intercorrelated; (b) EF and estimates of automatic processes both predicted implicit bias and also interacted, such that the relation between automatic processes and bias expression was reduced at higher levels of EF; (c) specific facets of EF were differentially associated with overall task performance and controlled processing estimates across different bias tasks; (d) EF did not moderate associations between implicit and explicit measures of bias; and (e) external, but not internal, motivation to control prejudice depended on EF to reduce bias expression. Findings are discussed in terms of the importance of global and specific EF abilities in determining expression of implicit racial bias. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

In both experiments, low-span participants performed poorly when task switching from antisaccade to prosaccade blocks. The findings support a controlled-attention view of WM capacity.

There were errors in Table 3 and Table 7 (these transcription errors were limited to descriptive statistics in the Tables and did not affect any inferential statistics). In Table 3, the ARRO-TUT and LETT-TUT variables had incorrect values for Mean [95\% CI], SD, Skew, Kurtosis, and N. In Table 7, the same values (plus Min and Max) were incorrect for the SEM-SART variable. The correct values for these measures are presented in the correction (the values for Min and Max were correct as set in Table 3, but are repeated below for clarity).] A large correlational study took a latent-variable approach to the generality of executive control by testing the individual-differences structure of executive-attention capabilities and assessing their prediction of schizotypy, a multidimensional construct (with negative, positive, disorganized, and paranoid factors) conveying risk for schizophrenia. Although schizophrenia is convincingly linked to executive deficits, the schizotypy literature is equivocal. Subjects completed tasks of working memory capacity (WMC), attention restraint (inhibiting prepotent responses), and attention constraint (focusing visual attention amid distractors), the latter 2 in an effort to fractionate the ``inhibition'' construct. We also assessed mind-wandering propensity (via in-task thought probes) and coefficient of variation in response times (RT CoV) from several tasks as more novel indices of executive attention. WMC, attention restraint, attention constraint, mind wandering, and RT CoV were correlated but separable constructs, indicating some distinctions among ``attention control'' abilities; WMC correlated more strongly with attentional restraint than constraint, and mind wandering correlated more strongly with attentional restraint, attentional constraint, and RT CoV than with WMC. Across structural models, no executive construct predicted negative schizotypy and only mind wandering and RT CoV consistently (but modestly) predicted positive, disorganized, and paranoid schizotypy; stalwart executive constructs in the schizophrenia literature\textemdash WMC and attention restraint\textemdash showed little to no predictive power, beyond restraint's prediction of paranoia. Either executive deficits are consequences rather than risk factors for schizophrenia, or executive failures barely precede or precipitate diagnosable schizophrenia symptoms.

The theory proposes that a control signal, such as an external stop signal or an error during performance, starts a stopping process that races against the processes underlying ongoing thought and action. If the stopping process wins, thought and action are inhibited; if the ongoing process wins, thought and action run on to completion. The theory is formally developed to account for many aspects of performance in situations with explicit stop signals, and it is applied to data obtained from 3 adult observers in a series of RT tasks. The relation between response inhibition and other acts of control in motor performance and in cognition is discussed, and the implications of the theory are considered in terms of current thinking about attentional control and automaticity.

Specifically, the WMC-antisaccade relation suggests that WMC helps maintain and execute task goals despite interference from habitual actions. Related work has recently shown that mind wandering (McVay \& Kane, 2009, 2012a, 2012b) and reaction time (RT) variability (Unsworth, 2015) are also related to WMC and they partially explain WMC's prediction of cognitive abilities. Here, we tested whether mind-wandering propensity and intraindividual RT variation account for WMC's associations with 2 antisaccade-cued choice RT tasks. In addition, we asked whether any influences of WMC, mind wandering, or intraindividual RT variation on antisaccade are moderated by (a) the temporal gap between fixation and the flashing location cue, and (b) whether targets switch sides on consecutive trials. Our quasi-experimental study reexamined a published dataset (Kane et al., 2016) comprising 472 subjects who completed 6 WMC tasks, 5 attentional tasks with mind-wandering probes, 5 tasks from which we measured intraindividual RT variation, and 2 antisaccade tasks with varying fixation-cue gap durations. The WMC-antisaccade association was not accounted for by mind wandering or intraindividual RT variation. WMC's effects on antisaccade performance were greater with longer fixation-to-cue intervals, suggesting that goal activation processes\textemdash beyond the ability to control mind wandering and RT variability\textemdash are partially responsible for the WMC-antisaccade relation.

One hundred thirty-seven college students performed a set of relatively simple experimental tasks that are considered to predominantly tap each target executive function as well as a set of frequently used executive tasks: the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Tower of Hanoi (TOH), random number generation (RNG), operation span, and dual tasking. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the three target executive functions are moderately correlated with one another, but are clearly separable. Moreover, structural equation modeling suggested that the three functions contribute differentially to performance on complex executive tasks. Specifically, WCST performance was related most strongly to Shifting, TOH to Inhibition, RNG to Inhibition and Updating, and operation span to Updating. Dual task performance was not related to any of the three target functions.

This article summarizes the EF research that our group has conducted to understand the nature of individual differences in EFs and their cognitive and biological underpinnings. In the context of a new theoretical framework that we have been developing (the unity/diversity framework), we describe four general conclusions that have emerged. Specifically, we argue that individual differences in EFs, as measured with simple laboratory tasks, (a) show both unity and diversity (different EFs are correlated yet separable), (b) reflect substantial genetic contributions, (c) are related to various clinically and societally important phenomena, and (d) show some developmental stability.},

  abstract = {One of the most important methodological problems in psychological research is assessing the reasonableness of null models, which typically constrain a parameter to a specific value such as zero. Bayes factor has been recently advocated in the statistical and psychological literature as a principled means of measuring the evidence in data for various models, including those where parameters are set to specific values. Yet, it is rarely adopted in substantive research, perhaps because of the difficulties in computation. Fortunately, for this problem, the Savage\textendash Dickey density ratio (Dickey \& Lientz, 1970) provides a conceptually simple approach to computing Bayes factor. Here, we review methods for computing the Savage\textendash Dickey density ratio, and highlight an improved method, originally suggested by Gelfand and Smith (1990) and advocated by Chib (1995), that outperforms those currently discussed in the psychological literature. The improved method is based on conditional quantities, which may be integrated by Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling to estimate Bayes factors. These conditional quantities efficiently utilize all the information in the MCMC chains, leading to accurate estimation of Bayes factors. We demonstrate the method by computing Bayes factors in one-sample and one-way designs, and show how it may be implemented in WinBUGS.},

  abstract = {The anti-saccade task, in which subjects are required to make a saccadic eye movement away from a target, rather than towards it, is a useful task for investigating the voluntary and flexible control of movement. Anti-saccades have a longer latency than pro-saccades and subjects are more likely to make errors on anti-saccade trials. These errors usually consist of a rapid saccade to the target, which is often corrected within a short latency by a second saccade away from the target. Two processes are needed for the anti-saccade task: suppression of the automatic pro-saccade, and inversion of the stimulus vector into the correct saccade vector.Monkeys and humans perform similarly on this task. In electrophysiological studies of monkeys doing the anti-saccade task, saccade neurons in the superior colliculus (SC) and frontal eye fields (FEF) seem to be inhibited before the target appears, to suppress the automatic pro-saccade. This is proposed to prevent activity in these neurons from crossing a threshold that would allow a saccade to be initiated. The suppression could arise from several sources, including other neurons in the FEF and SC, the supplementary eye fields, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the substantia nigra pars reticulata.The generation of the anti-saccade requires vector inversion and a build-up of activity in a different set of saccade neurons. Monkey electrophysiology studies indicate that vector inversion involves the lateral intraparietal area and/or the FEF.In humans, functional imaging and event-related potential (ERP) studies have been used to study the anti-saccade task. These studies have identified differences in brain activity between pro-saccades and anti-saccades that are consistent with data from electrophysiological studies in monkeys.Young children struggle to perform the anti-saccade task, apparently because they have difficulty in suppressing the automatic pro-saccade. This might relate to the protracted maturation of the frontal lobes, which have been proposed to mediate top-down inhibition of saccade neurons. Patients with lesions of the DLPFC have a similar deficit in performance. By contrast, lesions of the FEF impair the ability of patients to generate the anti-saccade.A number of clinical conditions affect performance on the anti-saccade task. Patients with schizophrenia show increased error rates and prolonged reaction times. Patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder struggle to suppress the automatic pro-saccade but do not show delays in reaction times, whereas those with Parkinson's disease have significantly increased reaction times and also an increased error rate. Tourette's syndrome causes an increase in reaction time with no increase in error rate, possibly because these patients generate increased top-down inhibition as a consequence of adapting to the disorder. All of these findings can be interpreted in the context of an 'accumulator model' of saccade generation.},

Our focus is on the receiver side: what makes an individual feel loved and how felt love is defined through daily interactions. Our aim is to explore everyday life scenarios in which people might experience love, and to consider people's converging and diverging judgments about which scenarios indicate felt love. We apply a cognitive psychometric approach to quantify a receiver's ability to detect, understand, and know that they are loved. Through crowd-sourcing, we surveyed lay participants about whether various scenarios were indicators of felt love. We thus quantify these responses to make inference about consensus judgments of felt love, measure individual levels of agreement with consensus, and assess individual response styles. More specifically, we (1) derive consensus judgments on felt love; (2) describe its characteristics in qualitative and quantitative terms, (3) explore individual differences in both (a) participant agreement with consensus, and (b) participant judgment when uncertain about shared knowledge, and (4) test whether individual differences can be meaningfully linked to explanatory variables. Results indicate that people converge towards a shared cognitive model of felt love. Conversely, respondents showed heterogeneity in knowledge of consensus, and in dealing with uncertainty. We found that, when facing uncertainty, female respondents and people in relationships more frequently judge scenarios as indicators of felt love. Moreover, respondents from smaller households tend to know more about consensus judgments of felt love, while respondents from larger households are more willing to guess when unsure of consensus.},

New method Test-retest reliabilities across an interval of about one week were obtained from performance in the antisaccade, flanker, Simon, and color-shape switching tasks. There is a general trade-off between the greater reliability of single mean RT measures, and the greater process purity of measures based on contrasts between mean RTs in two conditions. The individual differences in RT model recently developed by Miller and Ulrich was used to evaluate the trade-off. Results Test-retest reliability was statistically significant for 11 of the 12 measures, but was of moderate size, at best, for the difference scores. The test-retest reliabilities for the Simon and flanker interference scores were lower than those for switching costs. Comparison with existing methods Standard practice evaluates the reliability of executive-functioning measures using split-half methods based on data obtained in a single day. Our test-retest measures of reliability are lower, especially for difference scores. These reliability measures must also take into account possible day effects that classical test theory assumes do not occur. Conclusions Measures based on single mean RTs tend to have acceptable levels of reliability and convergent validity, but are ``impure'' measures of specific executive functions. The individual differences in RT model shows that the impurity problem is worse than typically assumed. However, the ``purer'' measures based on difference scores have low convergent validity that is partly caused by deficiencies in test-retest reliability.},

Simon effects across a variety of conditions, however, are largest for fast responses but decrease, and even reverse, as responses slow. We show in three experiments that these diverging patterns hold within participants and even when the stimulus materials are identical across the tasks.

At the same time, it has been subdivided into inhibition of prepotent responses (i.e., the ability to stop dominant responses) and resistance to distracter interference (i.e., the ability to ignore distracting information). The present study investigated the unity and diversity of inhibition as a psychometric construct, and tested the hypothesis of an inhibition deficit in older age. We measured inhibition in young and old adults with 11 established laboratory tasks: antisaccade, stop-signal, color Stroop, number Stroop, arrow flanker, letter flanker, Simon, global-local, positive and negative compatibility tasks, and n-2 repetition costs in task switching. In both age groups, the inhibition measures from individual tasks had good reliabilities, but correlated only weakly among each other. Structural equation modeling identified a 2-factor model with factors for inhibition of prepotent responses and resistance to distracter interference. Older adults scored worse in the inhibition of prepotent response, but better in the resistance to distracter interference. However, the model had low explanatory power. Together, these findings call into question inhibition as a psychometric construct and the hypothesis of an inhibition deficit in older age.

It remains unknown whether this difficulty occurs because inhibition is a disparate set of phenomena or whether the analytical techiques to uncover a unified inhibition phenomenon fail in real-world contexts.  In this paper, we explore the field-wide inability to assess whether inhibition is unified or disparate. We do so by showing that ordinary methods of correlating performance including those with latent variable models are doomed to fail because of trial noise (or, as it is sometimes called, measurement error).  We then develop hierarchical models that account for variation across trials, variation across individuals, and covariation across individuals and tasks.  These hierarchical models also fail to uncover correlations in typical designs for the same reasons.  While we can charaterize the degree of trial noise, we cannot recover correlations in typical designs that enroll hundreds of people.  We discuss possible improvements to study designs to help uncovering correlations, though we are not sure how feasible they are.},

  abstract = {In modern individual-difference studies, researchers often correlate performance on various tasks to uncover common latent processes. Yet, in some sense, the results have been disappointing as correlations among tasks that seemingly have processes in common are often low. A pressing question then is whether these attenuated correlations reflect statistical considerations, such as a lack of individual variability on tasks, or substantive considerations, such as that inhibition in different tasks is not a unified concept. One problem in addressing this question is that researchers aggregate performance across trials to tally individual-by-task scores. It is tempting to think that aggregation is fine and that everything comes out in the wash. But as shown here, this aggregation may greatly attenuate measures of effect size and correlation. We propose an alternative analysis of task performance that is based on accounting for trial-by-trial variability along with the covariation of individuals' performance across tasks. The implementation is through common hierarchical models, and this treatment rescues classical concepts of effect size, reliability, and correlation for studying individual differences with experimental tasks. Using recent data from Hedge et al. Behavioral Research Methods, 50(3), 1166\textendash 1186, 2018 we show that there is Bayes-factor support for a lack of correlation between the Stroop and flanker task. This support for a lack of correlation indicates a psychologically relevant result\textemdash Stroop and flanker inhibition are seemingly unrelated, contradicting unified concepts of inhibition.},

  abstract = {In a speeded choice reaction time task, responses to centrally presented letter targets can be altered by the identity of surrounding task-irrelevant letters (flankers). In the standard flanker effect, flankers associated with the same response as the target lead to faster and more accurate responses, whereas flankers associated with a different response lead to slower and more error-prone responses. B. A. Eriksen and C. W. Eriksen (1974, pp. 143\textendash 149) have argued that these flanker effects occur through response competition. We present data from a novel version of the Eriksen task, in which some targets and flankers consist of letter forms that aremorphed versions of target letters. In this paradigm, flankers induce classic flanker effects on well-formed targets. But flankers induce an opposite effect, termed anegative flanker effect on morphed letter targets. For example, targets that are morphs between the letters ``A'' and ``H'' are more likely to be identified as an ``A'' when flanked by an ``H.'' The interpretation advanced here is that there are two distinct kinds of flanker effects: contrast enhancement in perceptual processes and response competition in response selection processes.},

The central hypothesis in the theory is that increased age in adulthood is associated with a decrease in the speed with which many processing operations can be executed and that this reduction in speed leads to impairments in cognitive functioning because of what are termed the limited time mechanism and the simultaneity mechanism. That is, cognitive performance is degraded when processing is slow because relevant operations cannot be successfully executed (limited time) and because the products of early processing may no longer be available when later processing is complete (simultaneity). Several types of evidence, such as the discovery of considerable shared age-related variance across various measures of speed and large attenuation of the age-related influences on cognitive measures after statistical control of measures of speed, are consistent with this theory.},

These results suggest that speeded neural information processing may facilitate evidence accumulation during decision making and memory updating and thus yield advantages in general cognitive abilities. We used a hierarchical Bayesian cognitive modeling approach to test the hypothesis that individual differences in the velocity of evidence accumulation mediate the relationship between neural processing speed and cognitive abilities. We found that a higher neural speed predicted both the velocity of evidence accumulation across behavioral tasks and cognitive ability test scores. However, only a negligible part of the association between neural processing speed and cognitive abilities was mediated by individual differences in the velocity of evidence accumulation. The model demonstrated impressive forecasting abilities by predicting 36\% of individual variation in cognitive ability test scores in an entirely new sample solely based on their electrophysiological and behavioral data. Our results suggest that individual differences in neural processing speed might affect a plethora of higher-order cognitive processes, that only in concert explain the large association between neural processing speed and cognitive abilities, instead of the effect being entirely explained by differences in evidence accumulation speeds.},

Thus, it is unclear whether the association between mental speed and intelligence reflects advantages in a specific cognitive process or in general processing speed. In this article, we present a neurocognitive-psychometrics account of mental speed that decomposes the relationship between mental speed and intelligence. We summarize research employing mathematical models of cognition and chronometric analyses of neural processing to identify distinct stages of information processing strongly related to intelligence differences. Evidence from both approaches suggests that the speed of higher-order processing is greater in smarter individuals, which may reflect advantages in the structural and functional organization of brain networks. Adopting a similar neurocognitive-psychometrics approach for other cognitive processes associated with intelligence (e.g., working memory or executive control) may refine our understanding of the basic cognitive processes of intelligence.},

The models include one level of manifest variables and two or more levels of latent variables. It is the advantage of this framework that a few characteristic models can be adapted to a large number of structures by minor modifi-cations. Cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches are suggested for investigating different aspects of the person-situation issue. While the cross-sectional approach is concerned with behavior in different situations, the longitudinal approach deals with behavior observed at different occasions. Structural equation modeling provides the framework for the formal representation of these models. Some models are applied for investigating the structure of social optimism. For a sample of N=462 participants it is demonstrated that the model including three first-order latent variables and one second-order latent variable provides an appropriate representation of the data.},

Any correlational experiment can only be regarded as a sample and presents a certain amount of accidental deviation from the real general tendency. Accidental deviation can be measured by the 'probable error.' Accidental deviation depends on the number or cases, and on the largeness of existing correspondence. Probable error varies according to the method of calculation. While the number of Ss helps to reduce accidental deviation, it has no effect upon systematic deviation, except that it indirectly leads to an augmentation. Therefore, the number of cases should be determined by the principle that the measurements to be aggregated together should have their error brought to the same general order of magnitude. Suggests that probable errors must be kept down to limits small enough for the particular object of investigation to be proved. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

The present study investigated whether Stroop test interference, defined as the cost associated with ink-color naming in the incongruous stimulus condition versus in the basic color-naming condition, provides positive evidence for a kind of processing qualitatively different than that which is required for color naming or for word reading. Does the pattern of age-related differences in Stroop interference force the conclusion that the incongruous condition taps a qualitatively different kind of processing than that required for color naming or for word reading? We gave the CWST to 310 healthy adults. Their performance in each condition of the test replicates and extends previous findings. Structural equation modeling of the data showed a significant, direct link between age and performance in the latent factor associated with the incongruent condition. However, this direct link with age produced a relatively small increase in the model's fit; it amounted to only a .024 increase in the proportion of variance explained in the incongruent condition. In light of this small direct influence due to age, the most parsimonious explanation of our findings is that age effects in Stroop interference are due to age-related slowing (which is also indexed by color naming and by word reading) primarily; the findings do not provide positive evidence for a qualitatively different kind of processing that declines with age.},

Failures to replicate the bilingual advantage have been attributed to methodological factors such as comparing dichotomous groups and measuring cognitive abilities separately with single tasks. Therefore, the authors evaluated the 4 most prominent hypotheses of bilingual advantages for inhibitory control, conflict monitoring, shifting, and general cognitive performance by assessing bilingualism on 3 continuous dimensions (age of acquisition, proficiency, and usage) in a sample of 118 young adults and relating it to 9 cognitive abilities each measured by multiple tasks. Linear mixed-effects models accounting for multiple sources of variance simultaneously and controlling for parents' education as an index of socioeconomic status revealed no evidence for any of the 4 hypotheses. Hence, the authors' results suggest that bilingual benefits are not as broad and as robust as has been previously claimed. Instead, earlier effects were possibly due to task-specific effects in selective and often small samples. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {We propose a sampling-based Bayesian t test that allows researchers to quantify the statistical evidence in favor of the null hypothesis. This Savage\textemdash Dickey (SD) t test is inspired by the Jeffreys\textemdash Zellner\textemdash Siow (JZS) t test recently proposed by Rouder, Speckman, Sun, Morey, and Iverson (2009). The SD test retains the key concepts of the JZS test but is applicable to a wider range of statistical problems. The SD test allows researchers to test order restrictions and applies to two-sample situations in which the different groups do not share the same variance.},

  abstract = {Recent work on cognitive control focuses on the conflict-monitoring hypothesis, which posits that a performance monitoring mechanism recruits regions in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to ensure that goal-directed behavior is optimal. Critical to this theory is that a single performance monitoring mechanism explains a large number of behavioral effects including the sequential congruency effect (SCE) and the error-related slowing (ERS) effect. This leads to the prediction that the size of these effects should correlate across cognitive control tasks. To this end, we conducted three large-scale individual differences experiments to examine whether the SCE and ERS effect are correlated across Simon, Flanker, and Stroop tasks. Across all experiments, the results revealed a correlation for the error-related slowing effect, but not for the sequential congruency effect across tasks. We discuss the implications of these results in regards to the hypothesis that a domain-general performance monitoring mechanism drives both effects.

  abstract = {Cognitive control involves flexibly combining multiple sensory inputs with task-dependent goals during decision making. Several tasks have been proposed to examine cognitive control, including Stroop, Eriksen-Flanker, and the Multi-source interference task. Because these tasks have been studied independently, it remains unclear whether the neural signatures of cognitive control reflect abstract control mechanisms or specific combinations of sensory and behavioral aspects of each task. To address this question, here we recorded invasive neurophysiological signals from 16 subjects and directly compared the three tasks against each other. Neural activity patterns in the theta and high-gamma frequency bands differed between incongruent and congruent conditions, revealing strong modulation by conflicting task demands. These neural signals were specific to each task, generalizing within a task but not across tasks. These results highlight the complex interplay between sensory inputs, motor outputs, and task demands and argue against a universal and abstract representation of conflict.},
